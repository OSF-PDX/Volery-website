# What is Volery?

Volery is an initiative to create a free and open source multi-purpose and configurable conference app. We aim to provide a server software-suite with plug-in compatibility that will allow it to be configured to work with any CRM or other information management system as well as app software built with accessibility and non-profit orgs in mind.

Our hope is that anyone can easily spin up a Volery server, connect it to whatever internal information tools they use to organize their events, and immediately start serving a web app that anyone in their community can use.

# What does the name Volery mean?
Volery is a word for a flock of birds ([Merriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/volery)). We chose it as a name with the idea that our project's goal is to help people flock together  -- both in the sense of "flocking" to a particular conference, but also to help people find their "flock" once they get there.
